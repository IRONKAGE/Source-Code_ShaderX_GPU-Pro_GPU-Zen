2: OIT using PRECALC method
3: OIT using FIXED OVERDRAW method
4: OIT using DEPTH PEELING method

F6: save scene to disk
F9: load scene from disk
F: wireframe on/off (default: off)
H: HUD on/off (default: on)
NUMPAD *: Increase number of opaque cubes.
NUMPAD /: Decrease number of opaque cubes.


Command line options:

-method=[nosorting | linkedlist | precalc | fixedoverdraw | depthpeeling]
Select the OIT method to use.

-numcubes=<int>
Render selected number of opaque cubes.

-wireframe
Enables wireframe mode.

-notext
Disable any on-screen text.

-dumpframe=<int>
Dump frame number <int> to disk. To dump the first frame do "-dumpframe=1".

-quitafterframe:<int>
Auto-quits the application after the selected number of frames have been rendered. 
To quit after the first frame has been rendered do "-quitafterframe:1".


Examples:
To use the LINKED LIST OIT method to render a scebe with 4 opaque cubes, no text, dumping the 1st frame to 
disk and quitting immediately afterwards do:

DX11OITTest.exe -method=linkedlist -numcubes=4 -notext -dumpframe=1 -quitafterframe:1


DXUT command lines are supported:

-fullscreen             forces app to start full screen
-forcehal               forces app to use HAL (fails if HAL doesn't exist)
-forceref               forces app to use REF (fails if REF doesn't exist)
-forcepurehwvp          [D3D9 only] forces app to use pure HWVP (fails if device doesn't support it)
-forcehwvp              [D3D9 only] forces app to use HWVP (fails if device doesn't support it)

-starty:#               forces app to use # for the y coord of the window position for windowed mode
-constantframetime:#    forces app to use constant frame time, where # is the time/frame in seconds
-quitafterframe:x       forces app to quit after # frames
-noerrormsgboxes        prevents the display of message boxes generated by the framework so the application can be run without user interaction
