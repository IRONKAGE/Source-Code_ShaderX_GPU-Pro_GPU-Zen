OGLES

If usings OGLES 1.1 or above then the trainingcourse shows how to use 2 P-Buffers, 1 texture, several quads and an untextured polygon to create a nice effect. Alternatively if you are using OGLES 1.0 then it shows how to copy the backbuffer to a texture and apply that in the scene.

OGLES2

This trainingcouse shows how to use a frame buffer object to render to a texture. The trainingcourse switches the rendering between two textures and uses the previous frame's texture in the current frame to create an effect.

D3DM

This trainingcourse shows how to use render targets to render to a texture. The trainingcourse switches the rendering between two textures and uses the previous frame's texture in the current frame to create an effect.
