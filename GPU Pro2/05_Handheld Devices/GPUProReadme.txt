The demo can be compiled for Apple iPad/iPhone and Windows PC Emulation using the appropriate SDK package.

Instructions for building:

- Unpack the appropriate SDK (SDK_OGLES2_IPHONE_2.06.26.0716.tar.gz for iPAD, and SDK_OGLES2_WINDOWS_PCEMULATION_2.06.26.0716.zip for PC emulation) and unpack the EBook.zip package into SDKPackage/Demos.

- The relative project files are stored in the GPUPro/Build subfolder. Use these to build the project.

- The "data" folder needs to be copied in the working directory.
