Short Description:	How to do anisotropic lighting

Full Description:	
This example demonstrates two techniques for generating an anisotropic lighting effect on the mask. One calculates the shading for each pixel on the fly, the other is optimised by using a texture to lookup the shading values. Anisotropic lighting simulates the effect of surfaces with a grain, or grooves. This includes materials such as brushed metal, velvet and records.
