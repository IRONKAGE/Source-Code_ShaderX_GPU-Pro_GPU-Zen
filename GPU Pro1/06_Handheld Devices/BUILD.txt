This document illustrates the build process for the sample application on Windows PC Emulation and OMAP Zoom1/2.

The sample demo builds on top of the PowerVR OpenGL ES 2.0 SDK, publicly available at www.imgtec.com -> Developers -> PowerVR Insider SDK

** Procedure for Windows PC Emulation **

Once downloaded and extracted the SDK Package, a folder called SDK_OGLES2_WINDOWS_PCEMULATION_x.xx.xx.xxxx will be created.
Simply extract the Touchscreen_Based_User_Interaction.zip file into the newly created directory, so that the contents will be:
- SDKPackage
- Touchscreen_Based_User_Interaction

Then, open the Visual Studio solution file at Example/IntroducingPODTouch/OGLES2/Build/WindowsPC and compile it.

** Procedure for OMAP Zoom **

PREREQUISITES:
As a prerequisite, the graphics drivers and the publicly available tslib library need to be installed on the target filesystem.

A similar procedure needs to be followed for OMAP Zoom platforms: Download the SDK for OMAP3 from the website, copy the application folder accordingly and follow the following steps:

- Go to Example/IntroducingPODTouch/OGLES2/Build/LinuxGeneric
- Set the following environment variables:
export PATH=<path/to/arm/cross/compiler>:$PATH
export LIBDIR=<path/to/target/filesystem>/usr/lib
export TSLIB_INCLUDE=<path/to/tslib.h>
export TSLIB_LIB=<path/to/tslib.so> 

Type

make TS_SUPPORT=1 (for Zoom1)
make TS_SUPPORT=2 (for Zoom2)

The output binary will be stored at Example/IntroducingPODTouch/OGLES2/Build/LinuxOMAP3/ReleaseRaw/OGLES2IntroducingTouchPOD

Once built, it can just be copied to the target filesystem and run upon starting the graphics driver:

/etc/init.d/rc.pvr start
