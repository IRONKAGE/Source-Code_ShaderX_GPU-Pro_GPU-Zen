* Vertex Shader (Slow method)
*******************************************************************************
 This technique uses the most significant normal to the grained surface (i.e.
 normal in same plane as light vector and eye direction vector) to calculate
 intensities for the diffuse and specular lighting, which create an anisotropic
 effect. The diffuse lighting factor is defined as the dot product of the light
 direction and the normal (L.N). The specular lighting factor is defined as the
 square of the dot product of the view vector (eye direction) and the
 reflection vector ((V.R) * (V.R)). 
 For convenience these can be expressed in  terms of the the light direction 
 (L), view direction (V) and the tangent to the surface (T). Where the 
 direction of the tangent points along the grain.
