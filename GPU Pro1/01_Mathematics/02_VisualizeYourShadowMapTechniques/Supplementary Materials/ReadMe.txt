Folder [Images]:
   * In the sub-folders "TSM", "LISPSM" and "SSM", each file is named in the form "A_B_C.png", where
       A = {Ep, Eq, Epxq}, 
       B = {SSM, LISPSM, TSM},
       001<=C<=090, it stands for the angle between view and light directions.


Folder [Videos]:
   * "Experiment2.avi" is the video for Experiment 2 in the paper.
   * "Experiment3.avi" is the video for Experiment 3 in the paper. 
   * Both videos are encoded in xvid mpeg4 format.




** All figures/videos are generated with the following parameters:
   - n=1, f=400, phi=PI/6, 
   - all aliasing value (i.e. Ep, Eq and Epxq) are taken log2 for better illustration
