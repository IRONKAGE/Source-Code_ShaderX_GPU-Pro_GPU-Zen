This is a simple proof-of-concept WebGL implementation of our frame buffer compression technique. The difference between the three reconstruction filters is better shown with the " High Chroma Contrast" mode. For more details read our GPU Pro 4 article. 

Instructions to run the demo:
Open the "start_demo.html" file with a browser that supports WebGL. The demo was tested on Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome.  Please note that IE does not support WebGL.

Thank you for your interest on the technique. For any questions or suggestions contact me at pmavridis@gmail.com.
