/**
 * Helper to simplify keeping two shaders compiled with and without alpha test enabled. Compiles the given shaders
 * twice, with ENABLE_ALPHA_TEST = 0 and 1 defined. Interface is designed to be mostly compatible with SimpleShader.
 * Setting constants is not really supported, as it's a major hassle with OpenGL (need to bind the shader etc).
 * The only exception is setUniform(int), which must be used to assign samplers to texture stages, this will bind 
 * each of the shaders in turn and set the uniform, only meant to be done once after loading the shader.
 * For other uniforms, it's recomended to use uniform buffers, and bind them once, this makes it a lot easier to switch
 * shader (if all are set up to use the same buffer slots).
