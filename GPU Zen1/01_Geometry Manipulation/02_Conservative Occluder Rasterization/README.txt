This project requires Visual Studio 2015 x64 to run.
It uses DirectX 12, SDL2 and a modified version of AntTweakBar by Kevin Örtegren (https://github.com/kevinortegren/ClusteredShadingConservative).
The example scene is from the Intel Software Occlusion Culling Sample Application (https://github.com/GameTechDev/OcclusionCulling).

Note:
This project is not a good reference for proper resource usage in DirectX 12. Simplicity is favored over CPU overhead and latency.
