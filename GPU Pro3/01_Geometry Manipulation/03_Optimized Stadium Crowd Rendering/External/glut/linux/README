	  Files For Making a Mesa/GLUT System For Linux ELF

			    Version 0.0.6

//************************************************************

There are three files included in this archive:

	Glut.cf -- file required by imake-- use this to replace the
	  stock version that came with GLUT.

	Makefile -- Makefile required to build ELF library,  belongs in
	  the $GLUT_HOME/lib/glut/. directory.

	path -- the line required for ld.so to find the libraries at
	  run-time.  Add this to your .profile file.

//************************************************************

The steps to make this work are:

     1) Change into $GLUT_HOME/. and make a backup copy of the
	Glut.cf file. Then, take the copy from this archive and move it
	into $GLUT_HOME.

     2) Run the script to build all the makefiles:

	  ./mkmkfiles.imake

     3) Change into $GLUT_HOME/lib/glut/. and make a backup copy of
	the Makefile.  Now, take the Makefile out of the archive and
	replace the old one.

     4) WHILE STILL IN THE $GLUT_HOME/lib/glut/. DIRECTOR, RUN:

	  make
	
	This should build the shared library 'libglut.so.3.7'.

	IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS WITH HEADER FILE DEPENDENCIES, try
	doing:

	  make depend
	  make

	This should rebuild the Makefile dependencies.

	If this does not work, remove all the lines in "Makefile" below
	the line saying "DO NOT DELETE" (yes, disregard what the line
	says).  Then try "make depend; make"

     5) Make two symbolic links:

	  ln -s libglut.so.3.7 libglut.so.3
	  ln -s libglut.so.3.7 libglut.so

     6) Now, back up to $GLUT_HOME/. and:

	  make

	This will make all the example programs.

     7) Add the line from archive file 'path' to your .profile, or
	better to your systemwide (/etc/profile).  Then logout out and
	back in again (to refresh your path.)

	After this, your system should be working fine.  If you are
	having any problems with these files, or you have any comments,
	please contact me at pmarton@bgnet.bgsu.edu.  I've only tried
	this on a Slackware 3.0 (heavily modified) Linux PC, so
	different distributions may behave differently.

	Good luck, and <SOAPBOX> thank you Brian Paul, Mark Kilgard,
	Linus Torvalds and everybody else that fits for giving college
	students on a budget a decent learning enviornment.</SOAPBOX>
