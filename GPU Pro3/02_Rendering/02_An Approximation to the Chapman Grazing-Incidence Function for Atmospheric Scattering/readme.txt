This is the example ray-tracer, accompanying the article
"An approximation to the Chapman grazing-incidence
function for atmospheric scattering"
by Christian Schueler

The vertex shader and fragment shader are in GLSL.
There is a project file for Mac OS X ShaderBuild
that you can simply double click.

Be sure to select a sphere as the control geometry.
You can play with the runtime parameters.
For instance, to make a fluffy gas ball without
any solid surface, set the planet radius to 0 and the 
scale height to something like 0.1â€¦

Enjoy!
